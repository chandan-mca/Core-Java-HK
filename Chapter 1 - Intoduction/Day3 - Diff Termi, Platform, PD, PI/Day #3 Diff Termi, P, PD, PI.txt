Day #3: Diff Termi, Platform, PD, PI 
===================================================================
05. Different Terminologies used in all programming languages?
06. What is a platform, Platform dependency, Platform independency?
====================================================================

Different Terminologies used in all programming languages
=========================================================
 In all programming langauages we have 10 different terminologies

 1. Source code			-> Abc.c        Abc.cpp     Abc.java     Abc.py
 2. Compiled code	-> Abc.obj    Abc.obj      Abc.class      |
 3. Executable code	-> Abc.exe    Abc.exe          |           	 |    
											  |		        |	               |	             |
									    	\|/	          \|/	         \|/	           \|/    
											O/P	  		  O/P	    	  O/P	       O/P
											
 4. Compilation			-> Converting SC -> CC	
 5. Execution				-> Running CC to get O/P
 
 6. Compiler				-> Translation software that converts SC 			-> CC and saves 
 7. Interpreter			-> Translation software that converts SC/CC 	-> ML -> exe
 
 8. Compiled PLs		-> The PL that uses only Compiler 						-> ex: C and C++
 9. Interpreted PLs	-> The PL that uses only Interpreter 					-> ex: JS and Python
 10. Compiled & Interpreted PLs -> The PL that use both C and I 	-> ex: Java and C#.NET

 What are the differences between Compiler and Interpreter?
 ====================================================================================
		Compiler																						Interprepter
 ====================================================================================
 1. Compiler converts complete SC to CC				1. Interpreter converts either SC/CC
    at a time and saves the CC in a new file        			line by line into ML code and 
    in the hard disk in the PWD                     					executes that line directly, 
																							it does not save it in Hard Disk
						   
 2. Compiler is used for comilation							2. Interpreter is used for execution
    means [convert and save]			   								means[convert, run & produce O/P]

 3. Compiler is faster than interpreter					3. Interpreter is slower that compiler
    because it converts entire SC at a time        			because it converts SC/CC line by line
 ====================================================================================
	-> SC -> Source Code
	-> CC -> Compiled Code
	-> PWD -> Present Working Directory in which the SC is saved

05. What is a Platform, Platform dependency, Platform independency?
     Platform
      - A platform is a runtime environment in which a program is loaded & executed. 
      - A platform can be software only platform or hardware only platform or both. 
     
      - A computer platform is both software and hardware based platform , 
        that is OS, processor and hardware devices (ram and hard disk) 
 
      - A 'C and C++' program platform is OS, it means 
        'C and C++' programs are executed by OS directly

      - A Java program platform is 'JVM', It means 
       Java programs are not executed OS, they are executed 
       by one special intermediate software called 'JVM'. 
       
	- Java program platform is JVM and JVM platform is OS 

      - A Python program  platform is 'PVM'.
      - A .Net   program  platform is 'CLR'.
      - A HTML   page     platform is 'Browser'.
      - A audio and video files    platform is 'Media player(VLC)'.
     Refer the attached diagram
     
     Platform Dependency
      - A program that is developed in one OS, ex: windows,
        if it can not execute in a different OS, ex: Linux or Mac,
        We call this program as platform dependent program
       
      - The programming language using which we develop this program 
        is called platform dependent programming language  

      Refer the attached diagram	

     Platform Independency
      - A program that is developed in one OS, ex: windows,
        if it can be executed in different OS, ex: Linux or Mac, 
        We call this program as platform independent program
       
      - The programming language using which we develop this program 
        is called platform independent programming language.  


       Refer the attached diagram	
	
    Conclusion:	 
      - If a program or a software is directly executed by OS,
        then this program or software is a platform dependent 
	program and platform dependent software
	
      - If a program is executed by intemediate software,
        like JVM, PVM, CLR, then this program is platform independent program
