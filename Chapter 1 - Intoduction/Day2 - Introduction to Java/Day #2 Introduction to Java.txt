01. What is Java?
	- Java is a Platform Independent
	  Object-Oriented programming language.
	  
02. Why Java is invented?	  
	- Java was invented to achieve Platform Indepency
	  for developing internet based business application
	  
03. Who invented Java, in which year, released in which year?
	- Java was invented by Mr. James Gosling
	  in SUN Microsytems in the year 1991
	  for developing network based applications
	  
	- The first test version of Java  is relased 
	  in the year 1995
	  
	- The first version of Java 1.0 is relased 
	  in the year 1996 for developing projects

04. Types of applications?
	- All available softwares or projects or applications
	  are broadly divided into 2 types
		1. Stand-alone applications
		2. Internet applications

	- An application that is installed in one computer
	  and can be accessible only with in this computer
	  and can't be accessible from other computers via 
	  network is called stand-alone application

		For example: 
		  ATM, Calculator, MS-Office, Antivirus, VLC, ... are SA.
		  
	   Below diagram shows SA:
	   
	   
	   
	   
		
	- An application that is installed in one computer
	  and can be accessible from other computers throughout 
	  the world via network is called internet application
	  
		For example:
		  Amazon, irctc, instagam, bookmyshow, youtube, gmail,
		  Naresh IT, HKProgrammingWorld, etc... are IA
	 
	- Below diagram shows IA:
	 
	 
	 
	 
	 
	 
	 
	 
	- A  SA is a single computer and single user application
	- An IA is a multi computer and multi user application
     
	   Q1) Is browser a SA or IA?
		- SA, because we install it in our computer
		  and access it with in our computer 
		  
	   Q2) Is mobile app a SA or IA?
		- SA, because we install it in our mobile
		  and access it with in our mobile
