Day #4: C, C++ PL PD and Java PI
===================================================================
06. Why C and C++ languages are Platform Dependent?
07. How Java achieved Platform Independency?

06. Why C and C++ PLs are platform dependent?
	- The C and C++ programs are compiled targetting to one particular OS

	- The C and C++ programs compiled code contains Machine Langauge 
	  of a particular OS whose format is not understandable to differnt OS.
	  Hence this compiled code can not be executed by different OS, 
	  so C and C++ programs are called platform dependent
	  
	- Below diagram shows  C and C++ platform dependency

07. How Java achieved PI?

	- In Java, the program is not compiled targetting to any particular OS

	- In Java, the program is compiled into bytecode, 
	  which is an intermediate language all OS
	- Then later this byte code is executed by JVM 
	  by translated it into the current OS's ML code
	  
	- We have separate JVM for every OS, 
	   hence the same compiled code, byte code,
	   can be executed in all OS with the help of JVM
	- Hence Java achieved PI, that is WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere).
