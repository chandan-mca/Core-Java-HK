Introduction to Core Java
===============================
01. What is Core Java?
	- The Core Java is the main and the first course 
	  in Full Stack Java 	
	
02. What will we learn as part of Core Java?
    - As part of core java we will learn
	1. Java Languague concepts such as 
		- Programming elements, keywords
		- Data types, operators, control flow statements,	
		- OOP concets, etc...
		- Java Library (SH, EH, MT, Collections, etc...)
		
	2. Developing programs
		- Addition, substraction, etc...
		
	3. Developing projects
		- Bank, Online Shopping, Ticket Reservation, etc...
		  but all those projects can be only stand-alone projects
		  can not accessed from other computers via internet
		  
03. What is the diff bw Core Java, Adv Java & Spring, Spring Boot?
	- by using Core Java, we can develop only stand-alone application
	
	- by using Adv Java, we can develop internet applications, 
	  but its development is slow
	  
	- by using Spring and Spring Boot we can achieve fast developemnt
	
	- In companies all projects are web or intenet applications
	- hence to develop and fast develop, in comparnies
	  we use    [CJ     +   Spring Boot]
	
04. What is the syllabus of Core Java?
   - We devided core java syllabus into 5 units
	Unit #1: Java Fundamentals	[Basic programs development]
	Unit #2: Logical programming	[Math based programs development]
	Unit #3: Object-Oriented programming[Business applications development]
	Unit #4: Java libraray		[Predefined classes given by Java]
	Unit #5. Project development	[UI + Programming + DB[File system]]
	
05. Duration, fee, recordings, class timing?
	Duration: 3 months
	
	Fee	: Rs. 3500 without recordings
		      Rs. 6000 with    recordings
