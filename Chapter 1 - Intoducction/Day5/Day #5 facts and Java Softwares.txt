Day #5: Important facts and Types of Java Softwares
==============================================================
08. Important facts on Java program and Java software?
	Refer diagrams

09. Types of Java software?
	Java has two types of softwares
		1. JDK 
		2. JRE
		
	Refer diagrams
	
10. Difference between JDK, JRE and JVM?
      JDK  
	- JDK stands for Java Developement Kit.
	- It provides development tool compiler, runtime envronment JVM and API
	- Hence by using JDK software we can develop, compile and execute new 
	  program also can modify existing programs
	- In developer computer we must install JDK   
	 
      JRE  
	- JRE stands for Java Runtime Environent.
	- It provides only runtime envronment JVM and API
	- Hence by using JRE software we can only execute existing programs
	- In Client/Customer computer we must install JRE
	
      JVM
	- JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine.
	- It is a Java platform, its translation software
	- It is responsible for running Java bytecode by converting it into 
	  current OS machine language 
      
11. Why public JRE is removed in Java 11v?
	- In modren web applications development
	  the client UI prages are developed by using
	  HTML, CSS and Java script or React, for running
	  HTML pages JRE is not required just Browser is sufficent
	  
	- Hence JRE is not being used in a client system
	  so it is removed in Java 11v
	
	- From Java 11v onwards we have 
	  only one Java software that is JDK
