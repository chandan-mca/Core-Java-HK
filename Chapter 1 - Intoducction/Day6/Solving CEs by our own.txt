Closer Look at HW program, solving CEs and REs
======================================================
20. Closer look at HW program

   class FirstProgram {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
 	 System.out.println("HKProgrammingWorld!");
      }	
   }
	
 - In the above program the words 'class, public, static, void' are keywords. 
   We must use them with all letters lower case, becuse they are created in 
   Java language with all letters lower case.
  
 - The name 'main' is not a keyword, it is just a name of the method.
   we must also use the all letters lower case, because it is also
   predefined name
  
 - The names 'String, System' are predefined class names  
   which are available as part of JDK software. We must use them
   with first letter capital letter.
  
 - The names 'FirstProgram and args' are user defined names
   we can use either same name or different name 
   either with small letters or capital letters its our wish
   but we can not use space in between words.
  
 - It is recommanded to place '{' in the same line of class and method
   creation, we can place it in next line, but it is C language syntax style.
  
21. Types of errors occured in the program
	- In a program we will get 2 types of errors
		1. Compiletime Errors	(CEs)
		2. Runtime Errors	(REs)
    
	- An error that is occurred during a program compilation
	  is called comile time error. A CE is occurred due to 
	  syntax mistakes (wrong typing or wrong spelling). 
	  The Compiler throws CEs.
		For example: placing a statement without ends with ;
		             is a syntax mistake
    
	- An error that is occurred during a program execition
	  is called runtime error. A RE is occurred due to 
	  logical mistakes (wrong value or wrong logic). 
	  The JVM throws REs.
		For example: main method is not avilable in the class
		             is a logical mistake   

22. How can we become expert in a PL and How can we easily pass 
    'Written Test Exam'?
	- Learn as many CEs and REs as possible
	- Solve as many problems as possible  
	
23. Solving CEs and REs by ourself?	
    - To find max number of CEs and REs
    remove or modify the parts of the program
    as shown in the below take
     ============================================	
	  Senario		Expected Result
     ============================================	
	1. remove ;		CE: ';' is expected
	2. remove "		CE: unclosed String literal
	3. change S to s	CE: package system does not exist
