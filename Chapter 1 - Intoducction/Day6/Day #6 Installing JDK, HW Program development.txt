=================================================

14. Downloading and installing JDK software? 
	1. Open Browser
	2. Type 'JDK 21 download', press enter
	3. Click 'Java Downloads'-> JDK download page will be shown
	4. Scroll down the page -> Click JDK 21 -> Click Windows/macOS  
	5. Click 'jdk.exe' / 'jdk.dmg' file link, download is started
	
	6. After downloading is completed
	
	7. Click on JDK.exe file -> click yes -> Click Next
	8. Click 'Change' -> remove 'Program Files\Java\' carefully
	   make path as 'C:\jdk-21\' -> Click Ok
	9. Click 'Next' -> installation is completed -> click 'Close'
	10. JDK software is installed in 'C:\jdk-21'
	    This folder is called JAVA_HOME

    - Test whether JDK is running or not?
    	- Open command prompt [press start -> type cmd -> press enter]

	- Type the command 'javac  -version' press enter
	   it must display javac 21.0.x

	- Type the command 'java  -version' press enter
	   it must display java version "21.0.x" 
	
    - JDK software is installed and running successfully
    - Now we can develop programs


15. Softwares required to 'develop, compile and execute' a Java program?
	For developing, compiling and running a java program 
	we need 3 software
		1. Editor SW  -> Development (Type and Save)
		
		2. JDK    SW  -> For obtaining 'Compiler, JVM and Library' into our computer
		
		3. CMD    SW  -> For running 'compiler and jvm' softwares 
		                 for compiling and executing our java program 
				 
	We have all above three SWs in out computer,
	No we can develop a Java program

16. Java Programming Elements:
    Java supports 8 programming elements
	==============================================================================
	Progrmming Elements		purpose
	==============================================================================
 	  1. Module		-> for grouping packages
	  2. Package		-> for grouping classes
	  3. Class		-> for representing RWO in PW
	  			   and for grouping variables and methods
	  4. Variables		-> for representing values and allocating memory 
	  5. Methods		-> for representing operations
	  6. Constructors	-> for storing values on variables
	  7. Blocks		-> also for storing values in variables
	  8. Inner classes	-> for representing inner object of an outer object	
	=================================================================================	
	
17. Essential statements to develop, compile, execute and print some message on console?
	- Java provides 3 essential statements	
		1. class			-> for developing and compiling
		2. main method			-> for executing
		3. System.out.println(-);	-> for printing a value or message
	
	- The class is essential, because Java is an OOP langauge,
	  hence every program must starts with a class
	
	- The main method is essential, because main method is the 
	  initial point of class execution. JVM executes a class
	  starts with main method.
	  	Note: if class does not have main method,  
		      JVM throws error: 'main method not found'

	- The System.out.println(-); is essential, because 
	  in Java we can print any value or message only by using
	  System.out.println(-);

18. Java program structure
	- class contains main method, 
	  main method contains S.o.println(-)  statement

	class  <ClassName>  {

		main method {
			System.out.println(value/"text");	
		}
	}

19. Steps to develop a Java program?		
    - Java program develop, compilation and execition
      comes under 7 steps
	1. Open notepad
	2. Type Java code
	3. Save this program with .java extension
	   in the project directory

	4. Open command prompt
	5. Change drive and directory path 
	   to the project directory in which 
	   java program is saved
	
	6. Compile java program by usign 'javac' tool
	7. Execute byte code by using 'java' tool	 

20. Program #1: Develop a program to print HKProgrammingWorld on console

	Step #1: Open notepad [press Start -> type notepad -> press Enter]

	Step #2. Type below code

		class FirstProgram {
                    public static void main(String[] args) {
			System.out.println("HKProgrammingWorld!");
		    }
		}
			
	3. Save this progarm with the name Example.java 
	   in the folder "D:\FSJD\01CJ\01JB"
	   Note: Create above folder in your system, then save java program

	4. Open command prompt [press start -> type cmd -> press enter]

	5. Change drive and directory path 
		1. Type "D:" and press enter 
		2. Type "cd D:\FSJD\01CJ\01JB" and pres enter
		
	6. Compile java program by using 'javac' tool
		-> type "javac  Example.java"
			  |-> FirstProgram.class
			  
	7. Execute byte code by using 'java' tool	 
		-> type "java  FirstProgram"
			   |-> Output: HKProgrammingWorld	

21. What is developer, Compiler and JVM activities?
     1. Developer role is developing a java program
	1. Developing means 'Typing and Saving' a Java program is called development
	2. We develop a program by using an Editor SW software 
	3. We have 3 types of editor SWs	
		|-> Basic editor	 -> Notepad*	
		|-> Advanced Editor	 -> Notepad++, TextPad, Editplus*, Brackets	
		|-> More Advanced Editor -> IDEs [Eclipse*, IntelliJ, STS, VS Code]
		|-> For Initial chapters we will use Notepad then Editplus, then Eclipse 
	
     2. Compiler role is compiling a Java program		
	1. Convering a source code to a Bytecode is called compilation
	2. We use 'javac' command for compiling Java program
	3. As part of compilation, Compiler perfroms below activities
		|-> finding .java file with the given name in the PWD
		|-> reading source code from this .java file	
		|-> checking syntax of each statement
		|-> converting SC into bytecode	
		|-> saving this byte code in a new file with .class extension
		    with the 'class name' as file name
		    
     3. JVM role is executing a Java program  				
	1. Running the byte code and produce output is called exection
	2. We use 'java' command for running Java byte code
	3. As part of execution, JVM performs below activities
		|-> finding the .class file with the given class name
		|-> reading byte code from this .class file
		|-> run the byte code by converting it into current OS ML
		|-> printing output on console
